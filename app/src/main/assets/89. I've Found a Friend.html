<p style="text-align: center;">I&rsquo;VE FOUND A FRIEND</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. I&rsquo;ve found a Friend ;<br /> oh, such a Friend !<br /> He loved me ere I knew Him ;<br /> He drew me with the cords<br /> of love,<br /> And thus He bound me to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And &lsquo;round my heart still<br /> close-ly twine<br /> Those ties which nought can<br /> sev-er,<br /> For I am His, and He is mine,<br /> For-ev-er and for-ev-er.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. I&rsquo;ve found a Friend ;<br /> oh, such a Friend !<br /> He bled, He died to save me ;<br /> And not a-lone the gift of life,<br /> But His own self He gave me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nought that I have my own<br /> I call,<br /> I hold it for the Giv-er ;<br /> My heart, my strength,<br /> my life, my all,<br /> Are His, and His for-ev-er.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. I&rsquo;ve found a Friend ;<br /> oh, such a Friend !<br /> All power to Him is giv-en ;<br /> To guard me on my up-ward<br /> course,<br /> And bring me safe to heav-en.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The eter-nal glo-ries gleam<br /> a-far,<br /> To nerve my faint en-deav-or ;<br /> So now to watch, to work,<br /> to war,<br /> And then to rest for-ev-er.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4. I&rsquo;ve found a Friend ;<br /> oh, such a Friend !<br /> So kind, and true and ten-der ;<br /> So wise a coun-se-lor and<br /> guide,<br /> So might-y a de-fend-er.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;From Him, who lov-eth me<br /> so well,<br /> What power my soul can<br /> sev-er ?<br /> Shall life or death, or earth<br /> or hell ?,<br /> No ; I am His for-ev-er.</p>
