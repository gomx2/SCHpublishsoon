<p style="text-align: center;">TAKE TIME TO BE HOLY</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. Take time to be ho-ly,<br /> Speak oft with thy Lord ;<br /> A-bide in Him al-ways,<br /> And feed on His word ;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Make friends of God&rsquo;s<br /> chil-dren,<br /> Help those who are weak,<br /> For-get-ting in noth-ing<br /> His bless-ing to seek.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. Take time to be ho-ly,<br /> The world rush-es on ;<br /> Spend much time in se-cret<br /> With Je-sus a-lone ;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">By look-ing to Je-sus,<br /> Like Him thou shalt be ;<br /> Thy friends in thy con-duct<br /> His like-ness shall see.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. Take time to be ho-ly,<br /> Let Him be thy Guide ;<br /> And run not be-fore Him,<br /> What-ev-er be-tide ;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In joy or in sor-row,<br /> Still fol-low thy Lord,<br /> And, look-ing to Je-sus,<br /> Still trust in His word.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4. Take time to be ho-ly,<br /> Be calm in thy soul,<br /> Each thought and each mo-tive,<br /> Be-neath His con-trol ;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thus led by His Spir-it,<br /> To foun-tains of love,<br /> Thou soon shalt be fit-ted,<br /> For serv-ice a-bove.</p>
