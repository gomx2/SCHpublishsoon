<p style="text-align: center;">O WORSHIP<br />THE KING</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. O wor-ship the King,<br /> all glo-rious a-bove,<br /> O grate-ful-ly sing<br /> His won-der-ful love ;<br /> Our shield and de-fend-er,<br /> the An-cient of days,<br /> Pa-vil-ioned in splen-dor,<br /> and gird-ed with praise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. O tell of His might,<br /> O sing of His grace,<br /> Whose robe is the light,<br /> Whose can-o-py space ;<br /> His char-iots of wrath the<br /> deep thun-der-clouds form.<br /> And dark is His path on<br /> the wings of the storm.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. Thy boun-ti-ful care,<br /> What tongue can re-cite ?,<br /> It breathes in the air,<br /> It shines in the light ;<br /> It streams from the hills, it<br /> de-scends to the plain,<br /> And sweet-ly dis-tills in<br /> the dew and the rain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4. Frail chil-dren of dust,<br /> And fee-ble as frail,<br /> In Thee do we trust,<br /> Nor find Thee to fail ;<br /> Thy mer-cies, how ten-der !<br /> How firm to the end !,<br /> Our Mak-er, De-fend-er,<br /> Re-deem-er, and Friend.</p>
