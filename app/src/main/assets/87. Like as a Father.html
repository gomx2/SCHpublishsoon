<p style="text-align: center;">LIKE AS A FATHER</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. Like as a fa-ther pit-ies<br /> his child,<br /> So the Lord pit-ies<br /> the sin-ner de-filed ;<br /> Wait-eth in kind-ness,<br /> Pit-ies our blind-ness,<br /> Long-eth to wel-come,<br /> though of-ten re-viled.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. Like as a fa-ther when<br /> we be-lieve,<br /> Mer-ci-ful still, He<br /> will glad-ly re-ceive ;<br /> Lis-tens to hear us,<br /> Bless-es to cheer us,<br /> Pit-ies when-ev-er<br /> His Spir-it we grieve.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. Like as a fa-ther, ev-er<br /> the same,<br /> He hath cre-at-ed,<br /> and know-eth our frame ;<br /> Watch-eth the stray-ing,<br /> Guard-eth the pray-ing,<br /> Bids us to trust in<br /> His al-might-y name.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4. Like as a fa-ther, con-stant<br /> is He,<br /> God in com-pas-sion<br /> re-gard-eth our plea ;<br /> In need He com-eth,<br /> Pre-cious His prom-ise ;<br /> Fa-ther in heav-en<br /> for-ev-er to be.</p>
