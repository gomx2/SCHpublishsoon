<p style="text-align: center;">I COME TO THE GARDEN ALONE</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. I come to the gar-den a-lone,<br /> While the dew is still on the<br /> ros-es ;<br /> And the voice I hear, Fall-ing<br /> on my ear,<br /> The Son of God dis-clos-es.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ref :<br /> And He walks with me,<br /> and He talks with me,<br /> And He tells me I am His own,<br /> And the joy we share<br /> as we tar-ry there,<br /> None oth-er has ev-er known.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. He speaks, and the sound of<br /> His voice,<br /> Is so sweet the birds hush<br /> their sing-ing;<br /> And the mel-o-dy that He<br /> gave to me,<br /> With-in my heart is ring-ing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. I&rsquo;d stay in the gar-den<br /> with Him<br /> Though the night a-round me<br /> be fall-ing,<br /> But He bids me go ;<br /> Through the voice of woe,<br /> His voice to me is call-ing.</p>
