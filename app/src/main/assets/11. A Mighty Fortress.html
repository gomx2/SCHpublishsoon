<p style="text-align: center;">A MIGHTY FORTRESS</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. A might-y for-tress is our God,<br /> A bul-wark nev-er fall-ing ;<br /> Our help-er He, a-mid the flood<br /> Of mor-tal ills pre-vail-ing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For still our an-cient foe,<br /> Doth seek to work us woe ;<br /> His craft and power are great ;<br /> And armed with cru-el hate,<br />On earth is not his e-qual.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. Did we in our own strength<br /> con-fide,<br /> Our striv-ing would be los-ing,<br /> Were not the right man<br /> on our side,<br /> The man of God&rsquo;s own<br /> choos-ing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Dost ask who that may be ?<br /> Christ Je-sus, it is He,<br /> Lord Sab-a-oth His namea,<br /> From age to age the same,<br />And He must win the bat-tle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. And though this world,<br /> with dev-ils filled,<br /> Should threat-en to un-do us,<br /> We will not fear, for God<br /> hath willed,<br /> His truth to tri-umph<br /> through us.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The prince of dark-ness grim,<br /> We trem-ble not for him ;<br /> His rage we can en-dure,<br /> For lo ! His doom is sure,<br />One lit-tle word shall fell him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4. That word a-bove all<br /> earth-ly powers,<br /> No thanks to them, a-bid-eth ;<br /> The Spir-it and the gifts<br /> are ours,<br /> Through Him who with us<br /> sid-eth ;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Let goods and kin-dred go,<br /> This mor-tal life al-so ;<br /> The bod-y they may kill ;<br /> God&rsquo;s truth a-bid-eth still,<br />His king-dom is for-ev-er.</p>
