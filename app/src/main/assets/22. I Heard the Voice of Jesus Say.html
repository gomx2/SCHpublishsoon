<p style="text-align: center;">I HEARD THE VOICE OF JESUS</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. I heard the voice of Je-sus say,<br /> &ldquo;Come un-to Me and rest ;<br /> Lay down, thou wea-ry one <br /> lay down<br /> Thy head up-on My breast.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I came to Je-sus as I was<br /> Wea-ry, and worn, and sad ;<br /> I found in Him a rest-ing place,<br /> And He has made me glad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. I heard the voice of Je-sus say,<br /> &ldquo;Be-hold, I free-ly give<br /> The liv-ing wa-ter ; thirst-y one,<br /> Stop down and drink, and live.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I came to Je-sus and I drank<br /> Of that life-giv-ing stream ;<br /> My thrist was quenched,<br /> my soul, re-vived<br /> And now I live in Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. I heard the voice of Je-sus say,<br /> &ldquo;I am this dark world&rsquo;s light ;<br /> Look un-to Me; thy morn shall rise,<br /> And all thy days be bright.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I looked to Je-sus and I found<br /> In Him my star, my sun ;<br /> And in that light of life I&rsquo;ll walk,<br /> Till all my jour-ney&rsquo;s done.</p>
