<p style="text-align: center;">JOY TO<br />THE WORLD</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. Joy to the world,<br /> the Lord will come !<br /> Let earth re-ceive her King ;<br /> Let ev-ery heart<br /> Pre-pare Him room,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And heaven and na-ture sing,<br /> And heaven and na-ture sing,<br /> And heaven, and heaven<br /> And na-ture sing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. Joy to the earth,<br /> the Lord will reign !<br /> Let men their songs em-ploy ;<br /> While fields and floods,<br /> rocks, hills, and plains,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Re-peat the sound-ing joy,<br /> Re-peat the sound-ing joy,<br /> Re-peat, re-peat<br /> the sound-ing joy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. No more let sin<br /> and sor-row grow,<br /> Nor thorns in-fest the ground ;<br /> He comes to make<br /> His bless-ings flow</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Far as the curse is found,<br /> Far as the curse is found,<br /> Far as, far as the curse<br /> is found.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4. Soon will He rule<br /> the earth with grace,<br /> And make the na-tions prove<br /> The glo-ries of<br /> His right-eous-ness,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And won-ders of His love,<br /> And won-ders of His love,<br /> And won-ders and won-ders<br /> of His love.</p>
