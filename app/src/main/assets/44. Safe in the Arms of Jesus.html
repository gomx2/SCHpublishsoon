<p style="text-align: center;">1. Safe in the arms of Je-sus,<br /> Safe on His gen-tle breast,<br /> Here by His love o&rsquo;er shad-ed,<br /> Sweetly my soul doth rest.<br /> Hark ! &lsquo;tis the voice of angels,<br /> Borne in a song to me,<br /> O-ver the fields of glo-ry,<br /> O-ver the jas-per sea.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">2. Safe in the arms of Je-sus,<br /> Safe from cor-rod-ing care ;<br /> Safe from the world&rsquo;s<br /> temp-ta-tions,<br /> Sin can-not harm me there.<br /> Free from the blight of sor-row,<br /> Free from my doubts and fears ;<br /> On-ly a few more tri-als,<br /> On-ly a few more tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. Je-sus my heart&rsquo;s dear ref-uge,<br /> Je-sus has died for me ;<br /> Firm on the Rock of A-ges,<br /> Ev-er my trust shall be.<br /> Here let me wait with pa-tience<br /> Wait till the night is o&rsquo;er ;<br /> Wait till I see the morn-ing,<br /> Break on the gold-en shore.</p>
