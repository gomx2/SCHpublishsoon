<p style="text-align: center;">LORD, I CARE NOT FOR RICHES</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. Lord, I care not for rich-es,<br /> Neith-er sil-ver nor gold ;<br /> I would make sure of heav-en,<br /> I would en-ter the fold ;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In the book of Thy king-dom,<br /> With its pag-es so fair,<br /> Tell me, Je-sus, my Sav-iour,<br /> Is my name writ-ten there?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ref :<br /> Is my name writ-ten there,<br /> On the page white and fair?<br /> In the book of Thy king-dom,<br /> Is my name writ-ten there?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. Lord, my sins they are man-y,<br /> Like the sands of the sea,<br /> But Thy blood, O my Sav-iour,<br /> Is suf-fi-cient for me ;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For Thy prom-ise is writ-ten<br /> In bright let-ters that glow,<br /> &ldquo;Though your sins be as scar-let,<br /> I will make them like snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. Oh, that beau-ti-ful cit-y,<br /> With its man-sions of light,<br /> With its glo-ri-fied be-ings,<br /> In pure gar-ments of white ;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Where no e-vil thing com-eth<br /> To de-spoil what is fair,<br /> Where the an-gels are watch-ing<br /> Is my name writ-ten there?</p>
