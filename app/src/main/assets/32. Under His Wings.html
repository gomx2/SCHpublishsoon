<p style="text-align: center;">UNDER HIS WINGS</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. Un-der His wings<br /> I am safe-ly a-bid-ing ;<br /> Though the night deep-ens<br /> and tem-pests are wild,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Still I can trust Him ;<br /> I know He will keep me ;<br /> He has re-deemed me,<br /> and I am His child.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ref :<br /> Un-der His wings,<br /> un-der His wings,<br /> Who from His love can sev-er?<br /> Un-der His wings<br /> my soul shall a-bide,<br /> Safe-ly a-bide for-ev-er.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. Un-der His wings<br /> what a ref-uge in sor-row !<br /> How the heart yearn-ing-ly<br /> turns to its rest !</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Of-ten when earth has<br /> no balm for my heal-ing,<br /> There I find com-fort,<br /> and there I am blest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. Un-der His wings<br /> O what pre-cious en-joy-ment !<br /> There will I hide till<br /> life&rsquo;s tri-als are o&rsquo;er ;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Shelt-ered, pro-tec-ted,<br /> no e-vil can harm me ;<br /> Rest-ing in Je-sus<br /> I&rsquo;m safe ev-er-more.</p>
