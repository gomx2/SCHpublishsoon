<p style="text-align: center;">I HAVE A FRIEND SO PRECIOUS</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. I have a Friend so pre-cious,<br /> So ver-y dear to me,<br /> He loves me with such ten-der<br /> love,<br /> He loves so faith-ful-ly ;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I could not live a-part from Him,<br /> I love to feel Him nigh,<br /> And so we dwell to-geth-er,<br /> My Lord and I.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. Some-times I&rsquo;m faint and wea-ry,<br /> He knows that I am weak,<br /> And as He bids me lean on Him,<br /> His help I glad-ly seek ;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He leads me in the paths of light,<br /> Be-neath a sun-ny sky,<br /> And so we walk to-geth-er,<br /> My Lord and I.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. I tell Him all my sor-row,<br /> I tell Him all my joys,<br /> I tell Him all that pleas-es me,<br /> I tell Him what an-noys ;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He tells me what I ought to do,<br /> He tells me how to try,<br /> And so we talk to-geth-er,<br /> My Lord and I.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4. He knows that I am long-ing,<br /> Some wea-ry soul to win,<br /> And so He bids me go and speak,<br /> The lov-ing word for Him ;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He bids me tell His won-drous<br /> love,<br /> And why He came to die,<br /> And so we work to-geth-er,<br /> My Lord and I.</p>
